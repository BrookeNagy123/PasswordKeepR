# PasswordKeepR
=========
## Description

In today's digital age at both home and work, you have more online accounts than you can possibly remember. Since 81% of account breaches are due to weak or reused passwords, itâ€™s essential that each account has a strong, unique password. So how are you supposed to remember these strong, unique passwords? Let PasswordKeepR handle it!

This app allows authorized users access to all their passwords, from both personal and organizations. In a addition, users can generate a new password for their online accounts. Users will be able to generate a password based on the options the form will provide. Easily find, copy and paste your passwords for your favourite websites!

It's that simple! ðŸ˜‰
