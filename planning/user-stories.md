## User Stories Core
* As a logged-in user I can create new vaults, whether it is a personal vault or company vault because I need to group and share passwords differently. 
* As a logged in user, I can be assigned to an organization, because I am part of that organization AND the organization has access to multiple accounts
* As a logged in user, I add new usernames and passwords for a specific site, because I can save my accounts for ease of access later
* As a logged-in user, I can generate a new password for a specific account, because I need to create password for a new account or update the existing account passowrd; and I will be able to generate a password based on the options the form will provide (password length, contains lowercase, contains uppercase, contains numbers, and contains symbols).
* As a logged in user, I can edit/change my passwords anytime, because I forgot my password AND it's good to reset my password every now and then
* As a logged-in user, I can click a button which copies the password from the app, because I need to paste this password to a specific website to login.
* As a logged in user, I can see my accounts categorized by site, because I can easily find where my account is saved for each site
* As a not-logged in user, I cannot see other saved passwords, because that is a security risk
* As a logged-in user, I can access all the passwords of different accounts, because I need to know the passwords.
